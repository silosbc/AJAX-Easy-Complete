# Contributing to AJAX Autocomplete System

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the AJAX Autocomplete System. It's people like you that make the open-source community such a fantastic place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make will be **much appreciated**.

## How to Contribute

There are many ways you can contribute to our project, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests, or writing code that can be incorporated into the project itself. Below are some guidelines to help you get started.

### Reporting Bugs

Bugs are an inevitable part of the process of development. If you find a bug in the project, you can help us by submitting an issue to our GitHub repository. With a comprehensive bug report, you can help us better understand your issue:

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People **love** thorough bug reports.

### Feature Requests

If you have a new feature in mind, please suggest it by creating an issue and tagging it as a feature request. Feature requests are a great way to improve the project, but keep in mind that they should be viable and aligned with the projectâ€™s goals.

### Pull Requests

Pull requests are always welcome. Here are some steps and guidelines to help you along:

1. **Fork the repository** and clone it locally. Connect your repository to the original "upstream" repo by adding it as a remote. Pull in changes from "upstream" often so that you stay up to date so that when you submit your pull request, merge conflicts will be less likely.
2. **Create a new branch** for what you're working on (not from your master branch). Name your branch something like `feat-xyz` or `bugfix-xyz` where "xyz" is a short description of the changes or feature you are adding.
3. **See if the project tests pass**, including your changes. Add or update tests as necessary.
4. **Write a convincing description of your PR** and why we should land it. Include screenshots if your changes have visual impact.
5. **Commit your changes** using a descriptive commit message that follows our [commit message conventions](#commit-message-conventions). Adherence to these conventions is necessary because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.

### Commit Message Conventions

Our project adheres to specific commit message formats to ensure our version history is readable and consistent. Please adhere to these guidelines when writing your commit messages:

Example format:

```
feat(core): add 'commenting' option
```

The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of your library:

- `fix`: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in semantic versioning).
- `feat`: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in semantic versioning).
- Any other changes should be documented as `chore`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, and others.

### Additional Notes

- **Code Reviews**: All submissions, including submissions by project maintainers, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose.
- **Licensing**: Ensure that every file includes a proper license file header to indicate the license of the document.

Thank you for your contributions to making this project even better!
